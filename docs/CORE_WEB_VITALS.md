# Core Web Vitals Optimizations

This document outlines the Core Web Vitals optimizations implemented in the Horoscope AI App to improve user experience and SEO performance.

## Overview

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. The Core Web Vitals metrics focus on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability.

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1 or less.

## Implementation Details

Our Core Web Vitals optimizations are implemented behind a feature flag, allowing them to be easily enabled or disabled:

```js
FEATURE_FLAG_USE_CORE_WEB_VITALS_OPTIMIZATIONS=true
```

### Components and Utilities

1. **WebVitalsMonitor Component** (`src/components/performance/WebVitalsMonitor.tsx`)
   - Initializes Core Web Vitals tracking when mounted
   - Only active when the feature flag is enabled
   - Non-rendering component that collects and reports metrics

2. **CoreWebVitalsOptimizer Component** (`src/components/performance/CoreWebVitalsOptimizer.tsx`)
   - Wraps the application to apply Core Web Vitals optimizations
   - Adds resource hints (preload, preconnect)
   - Optimizes script loading strategies
   - Contains layout stability measures

3. **Web Vitals Utilities** (`src/utils/web-vitals.ts`)
   - Provides utilities for tracking and reporting Core Web Vitals metrics
   - Uses the `web-vitals` library to collect metrics
   - Configurable reporting mechanism

### Optimizations by Metric

#### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Optimizations

1. **Font Optimization**
   - Using `next/font/google` with `display: 'swap'` to prevent Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT)
   - Preloading critical fonts

2. **Resource Prioritization**
   - Added `preload` hints for critical resources
   - Marked first zodiac card with `lcp-target` class for priority rendering
   - Optimized video loading with explicit dimensions

3. **Media Optimization**
   - Implemented lazy loading for non-critical videos
   - Added placeholders to reduce layout shifts during loading

#### FID (First Input Delay) Optimizations

1. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Implemented code splitting and lazy loading
   - Used `useCallback` and `useMemo` for expensive operations
   - Deferred non-critical JavaScript execution

2. **Event Handler Optimization**
   - Optimized event handlers to minimize processing time
   - Moved heavy processing off the main thread where possible

#### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Optimizations

1. **Layout Stability**
   - Added explicit dimensions to media elements (videos, images)
   - Used placeholders with correct dimensions while content loads
   - Applied `contain: layout` to important elements

2. **Animation Stability**
   - Optimized animations to minimize layout shifts
   - Used transform-based animations instead of layout-affecting properties

## Testing and Monitoring

We've implemented a monitoring system to continuously track Core Web Vitals metrics:

1. **Automated Tests**
   - Unit tests for the Web Vitals utilities
   - Visual regression tests for layout stability

2. **Runtime Monitoring**
   - Collects and reports Web Vitals metrics in development and production
   - Console reporting in development mode
   - Configurable to send metrics to analytics platforms

## Feature Flag Configuration

The Core Web Vitals optimizations can be configured through environment variables:

### Development

```
# .env.development
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_USE_CORE_WEB_VITALS_OPTIMIZATIONS=true
```

### Production

```
# .env.frontend.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_USE_CORE_WEB_VITALS_OPTIMIZATIONS=true
```

## Future Improvements

Planned future improvements for Core Web Vitals:

1. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Integration with more sophisticated analytics platforms
   - Real User Monitoring (RUM) to collect field data

2. **Performance Budgets**
   - Implementation of performance budgets for key resources
   - Automated alerts for performance regressions

3. **Optimizations for Mobile**
   - Specific optimizations for mobile devices
   - Further reduction in JavaScript bundle size for low-end devices
