# OpenAI API Integration Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing or reviewing OpenAI API integrations in this project.

## Security

- [ ] API key is stored in environment variables only (never in code)
- [ ] API key is validated for existence before API calls
- [ ] All API requests are made server-side only
- [ ] User inputs are sanitized before being sent to the API
- [ ] Responses are validated before being used
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- [ ] Authentication/authorization is used to protect API endpoints

## Performance

- [ ] Requests are cached when appropriate
- [ ] Similar requests are batched where possible
- [ ] Exponential backoff is implemented for retries
- [ ] Token limits are respected and managed
- [ ] Request timeouts are configured appropriately
- [ ] Streaming is used for long responses when appropriate
- [ ] Conversation context is managed efficiently

## Cost Optimization

- [ ] Token usage is monitored and logged
- [ ] Costs are tracked and attributed
- [ ] Unnecessary API calls are avoided
- [ ] API usage has appropriate quotas/limits
- [ ] Most cost-effective model is used for the task
- [ ] Prompts are optimized for token efficiency

## Error Handling

- [ ] All API calls include try/catch blocks
- [ ] Different error types are handled appropriately
- [ ] Errors are logged with relevant context
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks are implemented for failures
- [ ] Rate limit errors trigger backoff and retries
- [ ] Users receive helpful error messages

## Code Quality

- [ ] Code follows the singleton pattern for client initialization
- [ ] Functions are small and focused on a single responsibility
- [ ] Configuration is externalized and easily adjusted
- [ ] Code is well-documented with clear examples
- [ ] Type safety is implemented throughout
- [ ] Tests cover critical paths and edge cases

## Deployment

- [ ] Environment-specific configurations are set up
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are configured
- [ ] Performance is measured and optimized
- [ ] Feature flags are used for new capabilities
- [ ] Rollback plans are in place
- [ ] Sensitive operations are protected by authentication
